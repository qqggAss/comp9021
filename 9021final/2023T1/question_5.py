# Given two sets sums and summands of integers and an integer a,
# computes the LONGEST lists of the form
# [a, a + n_1, a + n_1 + n_2, ..., a + n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k]
# such that:
# - a, a + n_1, a + n_1 + n_2, ..., a + n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k are all in sums;
# - n_1, n_2, ..., n_k are all in summands and DISTINCT.
#
# The code is already written to print out the lists in lexicographic order
# (together with extra information on how they have been obtained).
#
# You can assume that the function is called with sets of integers
# as first two arguments and with an integer as third argument.
