Sir Antonella said: "all of us are Knaves."
Also, Sir Cecelia said: "I am a Knight."
I met Sirs Cecelia and Antonella yesterday.
Sir Itzel said: "Sir Cecelia or I is a Knight."
It was said that "at least one of Sir Cecelia and Sir 
Itzel is a Knave," by Sir Itzel I believe.
"Exactly one of Sir Cecelia and I is a Knight," is what
Sir Itzel concluded.
