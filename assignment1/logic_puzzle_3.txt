This island is a very singular one. It consists of little else than the sea sand,

and is about three miles long. Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile.

All of a sudden, Sir Paisley said "I am a Knight," really out of the blue.

It is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek,
   
oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime,    
a favorite resort of the marsh hen.
