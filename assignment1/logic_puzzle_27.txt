Sir Anahi said: "Sir Khaleesi, Sir Allyson and I are Knaves," without being sure.
And now this. According to Sir Johanna, "Sir Khaleesi, Sir Anahi, Sir Allyson,
Sir Maxine or I is a Knight." Would oyu believe it, "exactly one of us is a Knave,"
is what Sir Khaleesi claimed! I only know about Sirs Khaleesi, Hayley and
Johanna, by the way. Sir Johanna, as usual could only say that "exactly one of Sir 
Allyson and Sir Khaleesi is a Knight," which as we know is stupid!
Sir Allyson concluded: "at least one of Sir Khaleesi and Sir Allyson is a Knight."
