Accoding to Sir Cheyenne, "exactly one of Sir Rosalia 
and Sir Estella is a Knight."
Sir Rosalia, on the other hand, believes that "Sir Cheyenne or I is a Knight,"
which sounds plausible. Not only that, "at most one of Sir Estella
and I is a Knave," was also claimed by Sir Rosalia today.
Sir Cheyenne forgot to mention about Sir Sevyn!
