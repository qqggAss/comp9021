Hear Sir Marilyn say "at most one of Sir Marilyn, Sir Penny and Sir 
Freyja is a Knight!" Sir Della thought that "at least one of Sir Freyja,
Sir Marilyn and Sir Penny is a Knave," which might be right. Also, that
"at least one of Sir Della, Sir Kenna, Sir Freyja, Sir Marilyn and
Sir Penny is a Knave," is what Sir Jazmin considers to be true.
Sir Kenna is sure that "at least one of us is a Knight."
"At least one of us is a Knight," is what we heard from Sir Jazmin.
