Sir Lea said: "at least one of Sir Braelyn and Sir Janiyah is a Knave." And Sir Sariyah said: "at least one of us is a Knight." Sir Azariah said: "at least one of us is a Knave," for sure!
Also, Sir Lea said: "Sir Janiyah, Sir Braelyn or I is a Knave."


Sir Aila said: "Sir Braelyn or I is a Knight." Sir Sariyah also said: "Sir Sariyah, Sir Azariah, Sir Bexley, Sir Braelyn, Sir Janiyah or I is a Knight." As for Sir Azariah, she said that "at most one of us is a Knave," maybe.

Sir Janiyah said: "at most one of us is a Knight." Really?
