Today, Sir Reina kept repeating that "all of us are Knaves,"
what is wrong with her?
Sir Henley just thought that "all of us are Knights."
But hey, "at least one of Sir Alejandra and I is a Knight,"
is what Sir Reina was sure of!
I think I forgot to mention Sir Dayana, also involved
in this stupid story.
