Sir Karla said: "Sir Zaylee, Sir Keilani, Sir Jamie, Sir Monica and Sir Zahra are Knights."
And Sir Jamie said: "at least one of us is a Knave."

"Exactly one of Sir Zaylee and I is a Knave," was said by Sir Karla. 
Sir Monica thinks that "at most one of Sir Zaylee, Sir Keilani and I is a Knight,"
but maybe not.
