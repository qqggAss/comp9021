I believe that Sir Janelle believes that "exactly one of us is a Knave."
"At most one of us is a Knave," is what Sir Naya claims. True or not,
Sir Janelle is sure that "at least one of Sir Kyra and I is a Knave,"
but who knows? Sir Janelle is not sure whether "at least one of
us is a Knight," good on her!
Sir Malaya, finally, claims that "at least one of Sir Kyra,
Sir Janelle and I is a Knave." What a mess!
