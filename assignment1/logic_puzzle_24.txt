A new story! First, Sir Amani said that "exactly one of Sir Liv, Sir Treasure,
Sir Noah and I is a Knave," but who knows. Then Sir Treasure added: "I am a Knight."
Where is Sir Jada by the way? That "at most one of I and Sir Amani is a Knight,"
is what Sir Liv claims. As for Sir Amani, she belives that "at least one of Sir Liv
is a Knave," strange again. "All of us are Knaves," is all what
Sir Treasure could tell us. Finally, Sir Liv said: "at least one of Sir Amani,
Sir Treasure and I is a Knave!" What do you think?
