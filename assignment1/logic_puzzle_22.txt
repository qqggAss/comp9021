Sir Leyla, who talks too much, says that "Sir Jayda, Sir Leyla
and Sir Mikayla are Knights." As for Sir Mikayla, that "Sir Jayda,
Sir Leyla or I is a Knight," is what she believes.
Why did not anyone talk about Sir Eileen? What a shame!
As expected, "all of us are Knights," is what Sir Mikayla pretended.
As for Sir Jayda, "I am a Knight," is all he could tell us!
Oh no, actually, that "Sir Leyla and I are Knaves," is something else
told by Sir Jayda!
