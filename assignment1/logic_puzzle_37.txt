"Exactly one of Sir Ashlynn, Sir Emmalyn, Sir Livia,
Sir Persephone and I is a Knave," is what Sir Aliya said.
Sir Denver said that "exactly one of us is a
 Knight," which is probably wrong.
As for Sir Kiana, she added that "at least
 one of us is a Knight."
That "at least one of Sir Ashlynn,
 Sir Emmalyn, Sir Livia, Sir Persephone, Sir Denver, Sir Harlee and Sir Aliya is a Knave," were the words of Sir Kiana.
Sir Ashlynn said: "at least one of I, Sir 
Emmalyn, Sir Livia, Sir Persephone, Sir Denver 
and Sir Harlee is a Knave," we will see.
Sir Livia said: "Sir Ashlynn or I is a Knight."
Sir Persephone said: "Sir Ashlynn, Sir
 Emmalyn, Sir Livia and I are Knaves."
