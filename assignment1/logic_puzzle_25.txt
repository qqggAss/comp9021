Still another story, involving Sir Winnie, who thinks that "exactly one
of us is a Knight." "At least one of us is a Knight," thinks Sir Keilani. 
Sir Winnie considers: "Sir Marleigh, Sir Hadassah and I are Knights,"
maybe yes, maybe no.
As for Sir Winnie, it is clear that "I am a Knight."
Do you know that Sir Hadassah said "exactly one of Sir Marleigh,
Sir Winnie, Sir Keilani and I is a Knight?"
And by way, that "at least one of us is a Knight," is what
Sir Hadassah believes. Finally, Sir Zaylee could not say anything
smarter than "I am a Knight."
