The only thing Sir Romina could say is "Sir Indie, Sir Karina and Sir Kori are Knaves."
Not too sure about that. Sir Kori said: "at most one of us is a Knight,"
but who knows. "At least one of Sir Indie, Sir Karina, Sir Kori and I is a Knave,"
is what is believed by Sir Aliza. Sir Indie is sure that "at most one of us is a Knave."
Finally, "exactly one of us is a Knight," is the claim made by Sir Indie.
Oh no, I forgot to mention Sir Aliza words, that "at most one of Sir Indie
and I is a Knight." Any clue who is what?
